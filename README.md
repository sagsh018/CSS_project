# CSS -- Cascading Style Sheets

## What is CSS?
CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets
CSS describes how HTML elements are to be displayed on screen, paper, or in other media
CSS saves a lot of work. It can control the layout of multiple web pages all at once

## Why use CSS?
CSS is used to define styles for your web pages, including the design, layout and variations in display for different devices and screen sizes.

## Sample code

    body {
        background-color: lightblue;
    }

    h1 {    
        color: white;
        text-align: center;
    }

    p {
        font-family: verdana;
        font-size: 20px;
    }

## CSS solved big problem

HTML was NEVER intended to contain tags for formatting a web page!

HTML was created to describe the content of a web page, like:

    <h1>This is a heading</h1>

    <p>This is a paragraph.</p>

    When tags like <font>, and color attributes were added to the HTML 3.2 specification, it started a nightmare for web developers. Development of large websites, where fonts and color information were added to every single page, became a long and expensive process.

To solve this problem, the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) created CSS.

CSS removed the style formatting from the HTML page!
